* Overview

The player controls a storybook-like animated monk named Geoffrey as
he travels through the wilderness fighting monsters and collecting
items. A point-and-click interface allows the player to travel to
different areas of the wilderness, move Geoffrey around the
environment, attack enemies, and cast spells.

Combat will consist of ranged attacks by the player, using a bow and
several different kinds of arrows. 

** Manage health, hunger, cold, and scarce food/resources 
** Magic spells
*** All spells require Mind points
*** Some spells require "reagents" i.e. a supply
** Story is exposed through the notebook, written letters/scrolls
*** I found two wraiths, but vanquished them. 
*** I collected skulls for making bone dust.

* Player attributes

** Equipped item
*** Supplies the verb for double clicking objects in the world ?
*** Usually the bow is equipped, so the verb is "attack"
*** When a spell is selected, the spell is cast on the clicked target, etc

** Inventory. 16 stacking item slots

** Statistics. Higher is better.
*** Body (0-100) (death at 0)
*** Mind (0-100) (used for casting spells. cannot cast anything when less than 15%)
**** Slowly recharges

** Conditions. Lower is better.
*** Hunger (0-100) 
**** You must eat periodically. When hunger > 80 your health drains
*** Cold (0-100)
**** When cold reaches 65% your health will drain small amounts (2-5 hp)
**** When cold reaches 80% your health will drain faster 
**** Reduce cold with camp or dry with Warmth
*** Fatigue (0-100)
**** You must eventually sleep. Cannot cast spells when Fatigue > 90

* Modeline status display

** " Equip [ITEMNAME]       Body 100   Mind 100        Hunger 0   Cold 20   Fatigue 30 "
** Can also show single-line message briefly
** Allow light-up color alarm when stat is low or condition is high or new message
*** Queue messages when there are multiples
  
* Gameplay screens

The game's world is shown from an overhead 2-D perspective. The world
view is full-frame, except for a thin black bar across the bottom
called the "modeline". This line is used for status display and
triggering the menu. It is mostly unobtrusive, displaying the meter
bars for Body (Red) and Mind (Blue), and an icon for the currently
equipped item/weapon. Status icons and some other messages will also
be displayed here. The various meters and items can briefly blink when
something requires the player's attention, such as wounding , hunger,
or fatigue.

<dto> my concept for this is that on some playthroughs you might find magic
      potions and spells in the item boxes and on dead travelers, and that'd
      be a somewhat more magical playthrough, whereas on other playthroughs
      you'd randomly get silver and crystal arrows.  [11:29]
<dto> and similarly, you'd find different story fragments, so that by the time
      you've had enough and got through to the ending, you've seen a pretty
      good share of the content.   [11:30]
<dto> this also means that the early and mid game can vary more than the
      endgame areas, since they'll be played less often

SHOULD be able to solve endgame both ways, most magic supplements combat

ALSO have a stealth spell, a way to avoid confrontation
