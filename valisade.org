* Overview
** Player controls an unnamed monk in several randomly varying quests
** Ranged combat with bow-and-arrow
** Melee combat with fists/feet
** Magic spells, all of which require some Stamina
*** Some spells require "reagents" i.e. a supply
** Manage limited resources: food, arrows, items/reagents
** Each quest is composed of your movements on the square sectors of a randomly generated worldmap
** When you move into a sector you get a randomly generated level in the sector's style
** Exploration and nonlinearity in what you gather/fight and in which order you visit squares
** Permadeath
** Story is exposed through the notebook, written letters/scrolls, NPC conversations, and the Astral Body spell
** Story pieces are randomly chosen (somewhat akin to special events or "vaults" in a roguelike)

* Movement and combat

* Music and sound

The fantasy soundtrack employs FM synthesis and sampling to create
abstract, synthetic timbres. The sounds and melodies are meant to
evoke various archaic instruments and vocal styles. Music does not
loop in the game; most of the soundtrack's cues are short (about 1
minute) and play once through when triggered by an event or situation.
My overall aim is to create the musical atmosphere in which an order
of spiritual warrior-monks utilize music for a variety of religious
purposes, and also incidental and improvised music played while
traveling long distances.
