* Gameplay screens

The game's world is shown from an overhead 2-D perspective. The world
view is full-frame, except for a thin black bar across the bottom
called the "modeline". This line is used for status display,
inventory, and menu. It is mostly unobtrusive, displaying the meter
bars for Body (Red) and Mind (Blue), and an icon for the currently
equipped item/weapon. Status icons and some other messages will also be
displayed here. The various meters and items can briefly blink when
something requires the player's attention, such as low health or a
poisoning event.
