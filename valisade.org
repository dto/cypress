* Overview

The player controls a storybook-like animated monk named Geoffrey as
he travels through the wilderness fighting monsters and collecting
items.

The game's world is shown from an overhead 2-D perspective. The world
view is full-frame, except for a thin black bar across the bottom
called the "modeline". This line is used for status display and
triggering the menu. It is mostly unobtrusive, displaying the meter
bars for Body (Red) and Mind (Blue), and an icon for the currently
equipped item/weapon. Status icons and some other messages will also
be displayed here. The various meters and items can briefly blink when
something requires the player's attention, such as wounding , hunger,
or fatigue.

** Point-and-click interface
** Ranged combat with bow-and-arrow
** Manage health limited food/resources 
** Magic spells
*** All spells require Mind points
*** Some spells require "reagents" i.e. a supply
** Story is exposed through the notebook, written letters/scrolls
*** I found two wraiths, but vanquished them. 
*** I collected skulls for making bone dust.
** Story pieces are randomly chosen (somewhat akin to special events or "vaults" in a roguelike)
