My name is Amalia.

I am the spirit who lives in the White Cypress.
Like those who dwelt therein before, 
I guide the souls of Ildran 
as they pass between worlds.

I will tell you now 
of an ancient time,

When ash and smoke concealed 
the fury of Sol.

When famine and despair
swept over Ildran.

When the Cypress died, 
leaving souls to wander
without rest.

When a man of humility,
with little more than robe and longbow, passed 
into the history of Heroes.
