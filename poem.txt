My name is Amalia.

I am the Spirit who lives in the White Cypress.
Like those who dwelt therein before, 
I guide the souls of Ildran 
as they pass between worlds.

I will tell you now 
of an ancient time,

When ash and smoke concealed 
the fury of Sol.

When famine and despair
swept through Ildran.

When the Cypress died, 
leaving souls to wander
without rest.

When a man of silent humility,
with little more than robe and longbow, 
passed into the history of Heroes.

Not for a Hero, 
nor for the wickedest,
can I reveal to you the destiny of Souls.

But of one Soul, 
of a malevolent shade,
of a Spirit most hateful and grim,
a designer of plagues,
and of vicious torments,

of this One,
I shall divulge a little more.

For though he vanished long ago,
The Universe will bear his imprint for Eternity.
