* TODO test embedding PNG files as encrypted arrays in the exe

 the only character stats in the game are moment-to-moment
      changing resources such as hitpoints, manapoints, cold, hunger. the
      monk's body does not actually upgrade and there are no
      XP/levels. instead atk/defense are upgraded by equipping new. in which
      case i think each episode's guy should start with a reasonable equipment
 also i think there should be episodes where you are not Geoffrey but
      instead his brother, in a prequel

* Overview

** Player controls an unnamed monk in several randomly varying quests
** Several things to do on your way, which vary
** Optional things
** Ranged combat with bow-and-arrow
** Melee combat with fists/feet
** Magic spells
*** All spells require Mind points
*** Some spells require "reagents" i.e. a supply
** Manage limited resources: food, arrows, items/reagents
** Each quest is composed of your movements on the symbols of a randomly generated worldmap
** When you move into a sector you get a randomly generated level in the sector's style
** Exploration and nonlinearity in what you gather/fight and in which order you visit squares
** Traditional RPG checkpoint save/load system
** Story is exposed through the notebook, written letters/scrolls, NPC conversations, and the Astral Body spell
** Story pieces are randomly chosen (somewhat akin to special events or "vaults" in a roguelike)
** Crime investigation tasks

* Gameplay flow

** Overworld map grid with terrain sectors.
*** Can open map at any time, but game does not pause. 
*** Can only travel 1 square at a time. Requires food.
*** Choose when to leave using map screen, unless held by conditions
*** Can return to a sector, but requires more food. 
** Exploration/combat as monk in a sector. This is the meat of the gameplay.
*** Any gameplay activity can be a mission goal.
*** Fight enemies
*** Cannot flee or craft when nearby enemies
*** Collect/craft resources/items
*** Explore ruins/caves for items
*** Discover story items
*** Brief "scroll story" cinematics

* Graphical presentation

All objects, evironments, and animation frames are individually
painted with acrylic artist paints on watercolor paper, and then
digitally composited and animated.

The game's world is shown from an overhead 2-D perspective. The world
view is full-frame, except for a thin black bar across the bottom
called the "modeline". This line is used for status display,
inventory, and menu. It is mostly unobtrusive, displaying the meter
bars for Body (Red) and Mind (Blue), and an icon for the currently
equipped item/weapon. Status icons and some other messages will also be
displayed here. The various meters and items can briefly blink when
something requires the player's attention, such as low health or a
poisoning event.

In-game text is rendered using an appropriate TrueType font. 

* Movement and combat

The monk's primary means of attack is the bow and arrow with which all
monks of the Order must acquire proficiency. Unarmed combat is less
powerful, but still useful at times.

* Player characteristics

** Body (0-100) (permadeath at 0)
** Mind (0-100) (used for casting spells. cannot cast anything when less than 15%)
** Hunger (0-100)
** Sleep (0-100)
** Cold (0-100)
** Poison (0-100)

* Controls

** Move with the arrow keys or numeric keypad
** Press SHIFT use the equipped weapon, item, or spell
** Press SPACEBAR (or "X") to pick up object / perform location-specific action
** Press ENTER (or "Z") to enter the menu and select menu options
** Control-S to swap Z and X buttons
** Use the arrow keys or numeric keypad to move the menu cursor 
** Press ESCAPE (or BACKSPACE or DEL) to quit the current menu

* Music and sound

The fantasy soundtrack employs FM synthesis and sampling to create
abstract, synthetic timbres. The sounds and melodies are meant to
evoke various archaic instruments and vocal styles. Music does not
loop in the game; most of the soundtrack's cues are short (about one
minute in length) and play once through when triggered by an event or
situation.  My overall aim is to create the musical atmosphere in
which an order of spiritual warrior-monks utilize music for a variety
of religious purposes, and also incidental and improvised music played
while traveling long distances.

* Story synopsis   

a deep-digging experiment of Industrialists create a device called The
Diamond Anvil in order to reach remains of an ancient civilization. it
causes a volcanic mega explosion, obliterating island blocking out sun
for two years and killing crops.  spirit of the white cypress guides
souls to the other world but the cypress herself dies during the sun
blackout, and her spirit becomes lost, separated from the tree. the
unguided souls of those dead from the famine, some fall into a fitful
slumber, or haunt the Earth for millennia; and humanity
dwindles. (Brother's soul is wandering too; reunited at end) After
figuring this all out over the course of the game, you go through a
ritual of purification to become the new White Cypress, and the game
ends. Revealed that Geoffrey is the storyteller; the Testament
combines the previous, female cypress' story with his.

The sequel is set in the time before the great explosion,
