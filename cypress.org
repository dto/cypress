* TODO test embedding PNG files as encrypted arrays in the exe

* Graphical presentation

All objects, evironments, and animation frames are individually
painted with acrylic artist paints on watercolor paper, and then
digitally composited and animated.

The game's world is shown from an overhead 2-D perspective. The world
view is full-frame, except for a thin black bar across the bottom
called the "modeline". This line is used for status display,
inventory, and menu. It is mostly unobtrusive, displaying the meter
bars for Body (Red) and Mind (Blue), and an icon for the currently
equipped item/weapon. Status icons and some other messages will also be
displayed here. The various meters and items can briefly blink when
something requires the player's attention, such as low health or a
poisoning event.

In-game text is rendered using an appropriate TrueType font. 

* Movement and combat

The monk's primary means of attack is the bow and arrow with which all
monks of the Order must acquire proficiency. Unarmed combat is less
powerful, but still useful at times.

* Music and sound

The fantasy soundtrack employs FM synthesis and sampling to create
abstract, synthetic timbres. The sounds and melodies are meant to
evoke various archaic instruments and vocal styles. Music does not
loop in the game; most of the soundtrack's cues are short (about one
minute in length) and play once through when triggered by an event or
situation.  My overall aim is to create the musical atmosphere in
which an order of spiritual warrior-monks utilize music for a variety
of religious purposes, and also incidental and improvised music played
while traveling long distances.

* Story synopsis   

a deep-digging experiment of Industrialists create a device called The
Diamond Anvil in order to reach remains of an ancient civilization. it
causes a volcanic mega explosion, obliterating island blocking out sun
for two years and killing crops.  spirit of the white cypress guides
souls to the other world but the cypress herself dies during the sun
blackout, and her spirit becomes lost, separated from the tree. the
unguided souls of those dead from the famine, some fall into a fitful
slumber, or haunt the Earth for millennia; and humanity
dwindles. (Brother's soul is wandering too; reunited at end) After
figuring this all out over the course of the game, you go through a
ritual of purification to become the new White Cypress, and the game
ends. Revealed that Geoffrey is the storyteller; the Testament
combines the previous, female cypress' story with his.

In the sequel you turn the diamond anvil back on to reach another world.
