"In Nothbehem before the Western Wars,
there was born a girl-child, Amalia,
with the seeming power of Premonition.

While in a trance-like state she would
write mysterious messages in a strange,
angular hand. These prophesied an
eclipse of the Sun not once but three
times in her long life. Her visions of a
great Hurricane helped spare countless
souls from drowning.

One day when Amalia had grown old, the
residents of Nothbehem awoke to discover
her little house burning furiously,
while she stood outside watching.

\"I shall give no more prophecies. I
shall leave for the mountains, and never
speak again.\" The townspeople begged
her to stay, but she would not listen.

They say she must have written something
terrible while in her altered state, and
burned the house in order to destroy
it. Now and then, travelers would claim
to have seen an old woman up in the
mountains---but only ever from a
distance---and that she could vanish
from sight in an instant. Some believed
that her sudden vanishings may be the
result of Witch-craft.

Such \"ghost stories\" about Amalia
circulated for many years. Their telling
was not limited to just the campfires
and pubs of this Valley, but spread
generally through Ildron as her 
disappearance became notorious. 

True or not, these stories illustrate
the ambivalence of the people toward
Amalia; for just as much as they desired
to know the future, they also feared her
Gift, and wished to hear only good
things from it. For what is Fear, if not
the dread of future events?

Our expedition was short, so far as
Paladins' typical jaunts go. While it
was understandably difficult to sort out
myth from fact in our conversations with
people along the route, we were told
consistently that Amalia had gone to
live in isolation by the black Mountains
of the north-east. Sightings of Amalia
tended to place her near the frozen
River Abyss, whose source has not yet
been discovered.

With the Pentaquin brothers and the monk
Brutus, we had an experienced crew of
Paladins, and moved swiftly and easily
in the temperate regions. But travel
became arduous in the extreme as we
searched farther North along the Abyss.

We could not cross the frozen,
treacherous Blackness; our brother
Alfonse met his death in our attempt.
Our determination thus broken, we
resolved to return home and deliver this
Report.

We can say only that we saw the
silhouette of a cabin-house, with smoke
coming from its chimney; and nearby, an
arrangement of large stones. But these
could not be reached, for they lay on
the other side of the River; and our
best hopes of a safe crossing died with
Alfonse.

Thus our Report could be seen as no
better than the stories that prompted
it; for our evidence is merely our
telling what we saw from afar.

For the expedition, 
Arturo Pentaquin")

"My name is Amalia.

I am the spirit who lives 
in the White Cypress.

Like those who dwelt therein before, 
I guide the souls of Ildron 
as they pass between worlds.

I will tell thee now of an age 
whose very stones have crumbled,
so long ago began 
this tapestry of Sorrows.

When ash and smoke concealed 
the fury of the Sun.

When famine and despair
swept through Ildron.

When the Cypress died, 
leaving souls to roam
in Shadow.

When a man of humility,
with little more than
robe and longbow, 
passed into the history
of Heroes.")

I can't find my way home...

Do you know which way lies 
the town of Nothbehem?"

"One, two, three.
That's violets here, 
Forget-me-nots!
Little ones shouldn't speak
to the Dead!
Oh, Goodness.

... Who is that?"

"Go away! I've got nothing to say to
anybody, living or dead!"

"Stay away from the caves, my son.
Ancient mecha-men dwell there; watchmen
of the Ages, who cannot die.
Ye may die to learn their secrets!"

"So many thousands of years...
trapped beneath Mount Einhall... 

their voices came to us through the
Wizards' magic glass..."

Diamond Anvil. For nine years my family
and I slaved at the construction."))

"Dear Geoffrey,

Francis and I are leaving for Valisade
immediately. We should have arrived by
the time you receive this letter. Please
meet us at the Cathedral as soon as you
possibly can. This is an urgent matter
but I cannot commit more to writing, as
I must depart at once. 

Make haste to Valisade, and be safe, my
friend.

  "Dear Geoffrey,

Our fondest hope is that this letter
finds you, and in good health. For the
message it contains will seem
predestined to break your Spirit.

Surely you noticed that the weather had
suddenly grown cold, and that the
vegetation had withered as if touched by
some sort of plague?

We failed to understand this ourselves,
until nightfall came and we saw that the
positions of the stars had changed so
much as to render several constellations
nearly unrecognizable. As Francis had
studied the ancients' commentaries on
Rama's Maps of the Cosmos, we drew
charts of our own and found that ages
had passed since our departure from
Nothbehem.

If we read these charts aright, then by
the time you read these words your
brother and I likely will have been dead
for more than five thousand years. For
as we crossed the mountains into the
North, each of us fell prey to magicks
involving Time, such that a delay in one
day's departure meant the passage of
five millennia.

You stand on the soil of of a continent
ten thousand years older than the land
you left. 

A continent whose very Souls are in
peril! A land you must rescue, if
Justice is to be brought, and if the
Souls of Ildron are to be saved from
wandering in Shadow.

Your brother and I have begun to
reconstruct what happened in the
centuries after our disappearance. It
would seem that Valisade became the seat
of a vast imperial power due to its
harnessing of the magic mineral
Xalcium. Valisade's warrior-priest kings
ruled over Ildron for a thousand years,
but this was disrupted by a sudden
catastrophe whose cause and nature are
not yet fully clear to us. An explosion
of some kind, perhaps a volcanic
eruption, obliterated completely the
isles of Einhall and Mir; much of the
surrounding coastal areas were laid
waste.

A rain of ash fell over the entire
continent; this was followed by a year
of perpetual dusk, in which the sun was
barely visible through the black
clouds. The pollution of the water
supply and failure of their crops led to
widespread famine, disease, and death.

We will tell you more in our next
letter. In the meantime, you must seek
out the Screech Owl; she will be waiting
for you in a forest due North of here.

"The alliance between the Black Wizards
and the Industrialists sparked the
invention of a most extraordinary
machine. The Wizards had secretly
discovered a method for making very thin
sheets of volcanic glass, with strange
optical and vibrational properties.
Pieces of a certain shape could condense
sunlight into flame; others could emit
ringing tones when struck.

The Industrialists affixed a carving
needle to a certain sheet of this glass,
made to an even more rarefied thinness,
such that highly subtle vibrations of
the Aether would be registered in its
movements. By setting this needle so
that it just barely scratches a rotating
wooden cylinder, which has been
beforehand coated with a thin layer of
wax, the spiritual or magical
vibrations, as such, are actually
recorded in the subtle wigglings of the
spiral left on the cylinder's
surface. By means of another similar
machine, these wigglings are magically
transformed into sound by vibrating
sheets of this same volcanic glass, and
can be listened to repeatedly.

Soon it was discovered that additional
voices could be heard on some cylinders,
that had not been witnessed by those
present at the recording. 

For this clever machine had suddenly
ripped open the doorway to communication
with previously unkown Spirits, both
good and Evil; inhabiting strange
domains of Being which had never
heretofore been imagined, by even the
Sages.
