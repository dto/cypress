"My name is Amalia.

I am the spirit who lives 
in the White Cypress.

Like those who dwelt therein before, 
I guide the souls of Ildran 
as they pass between worlds.

I will tell thee now of an age 
whose very stones have crumbled,
so long ago began 
this tapestry of Sorrows.

When ash and smoke concealed 
the fury of the Sun.

When famine and despair
swept through Ildran.

When the Cypress died, 
leaving souls to roam
in Shadow.

When a man of humility,
with little more than
robe and longbow, 
passed into the history
of Heroes.")

  '("...who disturbs me?
 ....
I can't find my way home...
 ...
Do you know which way lies 
the town of Nothbehem?"

"One, two, three.
That's violets here, 
Forget-me-nots!
Little ones shouldn't speak
to the Dead!
Oh, Goodness.

... Who is that?"

"Go away! I've got nothing to say to
anybody, living or dead!"

"Stay away from the caves, my son.
Ancient mecha-men dwell there; watchmen
of the Ages, who cannot die.
Ye may die to learn their secrets!"

"So many thousands of years...
trapped beneath Mount Einhall... 

their voices came to us through the
Wizards' magic glass..."

"We built a digging machine called the
Diamond Anvil. For nine years my family
and I slaved at the construction."))
