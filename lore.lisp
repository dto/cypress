"Official Report 
of the Expedition to the Abyss
38th Council of Nothbehem

In Nothbehem before the Western Wars,
there was born a girl-child, Amalia,
with the seeming power of Premonition.

While in a trance-like state she would
write mysterious messages in a strange,
angular hand. These prophesied an
eclipse of the Sun not once but three
times in her long life. Her visions of a
great Hurricane helped spare countless
souls from drowning.

One day when Amalia had grown old, the
residents of Nothbehem awoke to discover
her little house burning furiously,
while she stood outside watching.

\"I shall give no more prophecies. I
shall leave for the mountains, and never
speak again.\" The townspeople begged
her to stay, but she would not listen.

They say she must have written something
terrible while in her altered state, and
burned the house in order to destroy
it. Now and then, travelers would claim
to have seen an old woman up in the
mountains---but only ever from a
distance---and that she could vanish
from sight in an instant. Some believed
that her sudden vanishings may be the
result of Witch-craft.

Such \"ghost stories\" about Amalia
circulated for many years. Their telling
was not limited to just the campfires
and pubs of this Valley, but spread
generally through Ildron as her 
disappearance became notorious. 

True or not, these stories illustrate
the ambivalence of the people toward
Amalia; for just as much as they desired
to know the future, they also feared her
Gift, and wished to hear only good
things from it. For what is Fear, if not
the dread of future events?

Our expedition was short, so far as
Paladins' typical jaunts go. While it
was understandably difficult to sort out
myth from fact in our conversations with
people along the route, we were told
consistently that Amalia had gone to
live in isolation by the black Mountains
of the north-east. Sightings of Amalia
tended to place her near the frozen
River Abyss, whose source has not yet
been discovered.

With the Pentaquin brothers and the monk
Brutus, we had an experienced crew of
Paladins, and moved swiftly and easily
in the temperate regions. But travel
became arduous in the extreme as we
searched farther North along the Abyss.

We could not cross the frozen,
treacherous Blackness; our brother
Alfonse met his death in our attempt.
Our determination thus broken, we
resolved to return home and deliver this
Report.

We can say only that we saw the
silhouette of a cabin-house, with smoke
coming from its chimney; and nearby, an
arrangement of large stones. But these
could not be reached, for they lay on
the other side of the River; and our
best hopes of a safe crossing died with
Alfonse.

Thus our Report could be seen as no
better than the stories that prompted
it; for our evidence is merely our
telling what we saw from afar.

For the expedition, 
Arturo Pentaquin")

"Dear Geoffrey,

Francis and I are leaving for Valisade
immediately. We should have arrived by
the time you receive this letter. Please
meet us at the Cathedral as soon as you
possibly can. This is an urgent matter
but I cannot commit more to writing, as
I must depart at once. 

Make haste to Valisade, and be safe, my
friend.

  "Dear Geoffrey,

Our fondest hope is that this letter
finds you, and in good health. For the
message it contains will seem
predestined to break your Spirit.

Surely you noticed that the weather had
suddenly grown cold, and that the
vegetation had withered as if touched by
some sort of plague?

We failed to understand this ourselves,
until nightfall came and we saw that the
positions of the stars had changed so
much as to render several constellations
nearly unrecognizable. As Francis had
studied the ancients' commentaries on
Rama's Maps of the Cosmos, we drew
charts of our own and found that ages
had passed since our departure from
Nothbehem.

If we read these charts aright, then by
the time you read these words your
brother and I likely will have been dead
for more than five thousand years. For
as we crossed the mountains into the
North, each of us fell prey to magicks
involving Time, such that a delay in one
day's departure meant the passage of
five millennia.

You stand on the soil of of a continent
ten thousand years older than the land
you left. 

With painstaking archaeological
research, we have begun to reconstruct
what happened in the centuries after our
disappearance. It would seem that
Valisade became the seat of a vast
imperial power due to its harnessing of
the magic mineral Xalcium. Valisade's
warrior-priest kings ruled over Ildron
for a thousand years, but this was
disrupted by a sudden catastrophe whose
cause and nature are not yet fully clear
to us. An explosion of some kind,
perhaps a volcanic eruption, obliterated
completely the isles of Einhall and Mir;
much of the surrounding coastal areas
were laid waste.

A rain of ash fell over the entire
continent; this was followed by a year
of perpetual dusk, in which the sun was
barely visible through the black
clouds. The pollution of the water
supply and failure of their crops led to
widespread famine, disease, and death.

We have yet to discern what dark Magicks
conspired in the making of these events.
We do know that the sudden rediscovery
of Xalcium occurred soon after the
famous appearance of a Traveler, whose
name is variously given as Shane or
Samuel.

Though his motives are unknown, this
\"Shane\" became a powerful Mage, and
used Xalcium to extend his lifespan. For
we find references to a Samuel and a
Shamal, not only at the time of
Xalcium's first harnessing, but also
just before the great Disaster whose ash
layer can be found everywhere beneath
the soil.

I must wait upon the ebbing of the river
to dig more, uncover more ruins, and
find more documents in order to
understand what has happened to
Ildron. I must also manufacture more
Gears so that I can lock up the next
cave for you when the time comes to
share what I have learned.

I will entrust the gears to the Order of
the Screech Owls; seek them out in the
forests to the North, and they will
guide you to our next point of contact.

"Dear Geoffrey,

Good news! It's quite likely that your
brother and I are alive and well, as
Travelers. It's also very likely,
according to my calculations, that you
and I shall be reunited! Though perhaps
not in the present Age.

In the years since my last letter,
Francis and I have visited many sites,
dug many a trench, and translated
countless texts in order to shed light
on the events surrounding the Great
Disaster.

Among the Black Wizards there was a
child prodigy, a boy whose powers of
clairvoyance and Prescience terrified
and amazed his elders. We know now that
this child became the being variously
referred to as Shane, Samuel, and
Shamal. His true name is Shayol, and is
it he who set the calamity in motion.

The alliance between the Black Wizards
and the Industrialists sparked the
invention of a most extraordinary
machine. Thanks to the apparent genius
of Shayol, the Wizards had secretly
discovered a method for making very thin
sheets of volcanic glass, with strange
optical and vibrational properties.
Pieces of a certain shape could condense
sunlight into flame; others could emit
ringing tones when struck.

The Industrialists affixed a carving
needle to a certain sheet of this glass,
made to an even more rarefied thinness,
such that highly subtle vibrations of
the Aether would be registered in its
movements. By setting this needle so
that it just barely scratches a rotating
wooden cylinder, which has been
beforehand coated with a thin layer of
wax, the spiritual or magical
vibrations, as such, are actually
recorded in the subtle wigglings of the
spiral left on the cylinder's
surface. By means of another similar
machine, these wigglings are magically
transformed into sound by vibrating
sheets of this same volcanic glass, and
can be listened to repeatedly.

Soon it was discovered that additional
voices could be heard on some cylinders,
that had not been witnessed by those
present at the recording. 

For this clever machine had suddenly
ripped open the doorway to communication
with previously unkown Spirits, both
good and Evil; inhabiting strange
domains of Being which had never
heretofore been imagined, by even the
Sages.

This was a grave development, for with
this \"Cylindrophone\" the Wizards made
contact with a strange Being, an Entity
which had before influenced only Shayol
himself. Of the Entity itself we hear
only whispers, for it was forbidden to
write or speak about. But we know that
thousands became its slaves by the
clever plans of Shayol.

It is this Entity, not Shayol himself,
that is our real problem.

It is this Entity who made Valisade into
an Empire for a thousand years, and then
simply destroyed it. 

For Shayol claimed another invention, a
drilling device known as the Diamond
Anvil. He promised them great stores of
Xalcium and other precious metals, if
only they would labor for decades to
build the device and burrow deep beneath
Mount Einhall.

But the machine's true purpose was to
destroy Ildron by igniting the Xalcium
chamber within the dormant volcano.

We haven't yet learned why the Entity
should want this. But I will say one
thing. The Entity is also a Traveler,
and has covered an utterly vast
timespan. It comes from a time more
ancient than Ildron, older even than the
Sun. It must have been formed in the
very mists of primordial existence. It
could be that this Being's purposes,
even its forms of conception, will be
entirely incomprehensible to us.

Shayol does not need the cylindrophone
to communicate telepathically, but his
henchmen do. This \"beaureaucratic\"
requirement has worked to our benefit as
investigators, for we have been able to
find some of the cylinders and thereby
eavesdrop on their correspondence.

They are urgently seeking a Prescient
woman whose name I have not been able to
find; they have peeked into many decades
to find her, but to no avail thus
far. (I suspect that she is not yet born
at the time of this writing.) They
appear to see her as some kind of
threat, and are working at any cost to
eliminate her.

Unfortunately, they feel the same way
about you, Geoffrey. Gather your
strength, for you must find the
Prescient woman and defeat Shayol's
malevolent designs.

We must move on from this encampment;
it isn't safe here. Be well, Geoffrey.
Be brave.
