(defparameter *amalia-poem*
"My name is Amalia.

I am the spirit who lives 
in the White Cypress.

Like those who dwelt therein before, 
I guide the souls of Ildran 
as they pass between worlds.

I will tell thee now of an age 
whose very stones have crumbled,
so long ago began 
this tapestry of Sorrows.

When ash and smoke concealed 
the fury of the Sun.

When famine and despair
swept through Ildran.

When the Cypress died, 
leaving souls to roam
in Shadow.

When a man of humility,
with little more than
robe and longbow, 
passed into the history
of Heroes.")
