In Nothbehem a few years after Geoffrey's disappearance, there was
born a girl-child, Amalia, with the seeming power of Premonition.

While in a trance-like state she would write mysterious messages in a
strange, angular hand. These prophesied an eclipse of the Sun not once
but three times in her long life. Her visions of a great Hurricane
helped spare countless souls from drowning. 

One day when Amalia had grown old, the residents of Nothbehem awoke to
discover her little house burning furiously, while she stood outside
watching. 

"I shall give no more prophecies. I shall leave for the mountains, and
never speak again." The townspeople begged her to say, but she would
not listen.

They say she must have written something terrible while in her altered
state, and burned the house in order to destroy it. Now and then,
travelers would claim to have seen an old woman up in the
mountains---but only ever from a distance. Stories about Amalia
circulated for centuries.

 - Arturo Pentaquin will turn out to have led an expedition to find
   Amalia. But they find only another burnt house. Where he finds the
   charred ceramic ink jar Amalia must have used to make some final
   Prophecy.
