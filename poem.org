My name is Amalia.

I am the Spirit who lives in the White Cypress.

Like those who dwelt therein before, 
I guide the souls of Ildran 
as they pass between worlds.

I will tell thee now 
of an Age whose very stones have vanished,
so long ago began 
this tapestry of Sorrows.

When ash and smoke concealed 
the fury of the Sun,

When famine and despair
swept through Ildran,

When the Cypress died, 
leaving souls to roam in Shadow,

When a man of humility,
with little more than robe and longbow, passed
into the history of Heroes.

Not for Heroes
nor for wicked men,
can I reveal to thee
the destinies of Souls.

But of one blackened Soul, 
a malevolent Shade,
a Spirit most hateful and grim,
a designer of plagues,
and of vicious torments,

of this One,
I shall divulge, to thee,
a little more.

For though he vanished long before the birth of Sol,
His crimes will echo into Eternity.
